# Majoras Music-Box House 

This repository contains custom music files for the Majora's Mask Randomizer, as well as the tools necessary to create a Majora's Mask audiobin file so Majora's Mask Randomizer custom music files can be used with the Ocarina of Time Randomizer.

### Majora's Mask Audiobin
To learn how to create a Majora's Mask audiobin file, please read the guide in the "Majora's Mask Audiobin" folder of this repository.

# Requests
If there is a song you would like to be converted to a Majora's Mask binary sequence file (`.seq`), then packed into a Majora's Mask custom music file (`.mmrs`), and added to the repository, feel free to request it by opening an issue with "`[Request]`" in the title.

# Issues with Sequences
Should you find — while playing yourself or watching a stream — that a track has volume issues or other in-game issues, please feel free to either open an issue, or contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/EVpd499gkS) in the `#songs-with-issues` channel.


# Submissions
The best way to submit your own custom music is by following the [GitKraken guide on the randomizer's wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=GitKraken). As long as the custom music works — and does not have any objectively bad audio issues — it will be merged into the main branch.

If you believe a sequence can be better adapted, you can either contact the original author and collaborate on improving it to replace the current one, or submit it as a second custom music file with an identifier in the filename to distinguish it from other files.

You can also submit a true remix or original creation if you do not wish to recreate a piece of music entirely.


# DMCA-Critical Sequences
Use them at your OWN risk.
