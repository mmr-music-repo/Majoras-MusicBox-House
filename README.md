# Majoras-MusicBox-House 

The `.zip` here contains the resources required for custom music sequences for the Ocarina of Time & Majora's Mask Randomizer.

To be able to use the sequence made for Majora's Mask Randomizer in Ocarina of Time Randomizer, please read the readme: `create_mm_audiobin.txt`.

# Requests
If there is a song you would like to be converted to Nintendo 64's compressed MIDI format (`.seq`, `.aseq`, `.zseq`), then packed into a Majora's Mask custom music file (`.mmrs`), and added to the repository, feel free to request it by opening an issue with "`[Request]`" in the title.

# Issues with Sequences

Should you find while playing yourself — or while watching a stream — that a track has volume issues or other in-game issues, please feel free to either open an issue, or contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/EVpd499gkS) in the `#songs-with-issues` channel.


# Submissions
The best way to submit your own custom music is by following the [GitKraken guide on the randomizer's wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=GitKraken). As long as the custom music works — and does not have any objectively bad audio issues — it will be merged into the main branch.

If you believe a sequence can be better adapted, you can either contact the original author and collaborate on improving it to replace the current one, or submit it as a second custom music file with an identifier in the filename to distinguish it from other files.

You can also submit a true remix or original creation if you do not wish to recreate a piece of music entirely.


# DMCA-Critical Sequences
Use them at your OWN risk.
